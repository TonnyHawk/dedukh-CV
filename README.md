# Portfolio Website for a Designer

[See it live](https://tonnyhawk.github.io/dedukh-CV/)

## Layout challenges that were solved:

* The website doesn’t have a strict grid layout, so each section had to be adapted individually. Breakpoints were chosen based on how the content looked on different screens.

* iPad screens are more square-shaped than rectangular, which caused the chat bar to drop too low and extend outside the main section. According to the designer’s concept, it was supposed to stay just at the bottom of that section. Therefore, I wrote a script that applies “mobile-style” CSS rules to the chat bar specifically on more square-shaped screens.

* The “CV” section has a very unusual, non-grid structure, so its appearance varies greatly between phones, tablets, and desktop screens. Nevertheless, it looks visually appealing on all of them.

## Technologies used:

* Flexbox
* Sass
* JavaScript, jQuery

Would you like me to make the English version sound more **professional and portfolio-ready**, e.g., suitable for your GitHub or resume?
